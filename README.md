## Overview

This repository contains reproduced experiments in  
_'A Baseline for Detecting Misclassified and Out-of-Distribution Examples in Neural Networks
'_, by Hendrycks et al.  
Built under version **tensorflow==1.8, python==3.6.**

I tried to keep the code simple but still nasty enough to confuse you. Any suggestions or corrections are welcome.

### Todo:
- Apply moving average to trained parameters, using tf.train.ExponentialMovingAverage()
- Gelu Nonlinearity
